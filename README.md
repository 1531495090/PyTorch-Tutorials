# PyTorch-Tutorials
This repository contains notebooks to learn Pytorch step by step. All are written in jupyter notebook so that one can tweak the code and check the results for the same.
### Content 
* <a href = "https://github.com/harsh-99/PyTorch-Tutorials/blob/master/Basic%20and%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb">Basic and Linear Regression</a> - Tensors, tensors to numpy and vice versa, training a normal linear regression model
* Logistic regression and Neural Network - Help you load a dataset, Basic architecture of writing a neural network, build a logistic regression model and neural network. 
* CNN and Resnet - This help you to write a CNN network and a complex network like Resnet so that you can then write any other netwrok by your own. Also it tells how to save and load model and what's the difference between saving the parameter and whole model.
* Custom Dataset and Trasfer Learning - It helps you to learn how to load a pretrained network and how to freeze layers, how to tweak a pretrained model and Finally some important tips on how to make a custom dataset loader which is of great essence now.
* GANS - Moving to more advanced networks, an application of what you have learned above.

### Dependencies
* Pytorch
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python 3
